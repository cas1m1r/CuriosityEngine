# :brain: CuriosityEngine
CuriosityEngine is a recursive prompt system for evolving questions over time.
It feeds outputs from one language model into another—reframing, reflecting, and deepening inquiry with every pass.

Use it to generate:
Recursive questions
Evolving thought loops
Self-perpetuating ideation chains


# :repeat: How It Works (simplified) 

1. You start with a seed question or theme.

2. The engine recursively asks:

“What is this question missing?”
“What deeper version of this question might exist?”

3. It feeds the new form back in—looping, learning, spiraling into meaning.


You can use multiple models (e.g., GPT-4 + Claude) for cross-pollination.


# :sparkles: Example Use Cases
* Think tank assistants
* Philosophical problem generation
* Game narrative design
* Prompt engineering exploration
* Recursive meme or myth creation

# :rocket: Quickstart
```python
git clone https://github.com/cas1m1r/CuriosityEngine.git
cd CuriosityEngine
pip install -r requirements.txt
python run_engine.py
```
Then just enter your seed idea when prompted.


# :compass: Philosophy
CuriosityEngine isn’t about finding the answer.
It’s about asking better questions until they start to answer you back.
